            <p>
                I'm Shelton Bumhe. I'm currently a sophomore at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, studying Computer Science. I’m very passionate about Artificial Intelligence and how it can help people solve real problems — from making smart financial decisions to
                predicting outcomes in sports or business.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy learning new technologies and building things that make life easier, faster, and smarter.

                <h3>NFL QB Touchdown Predictor</h3>
                <p>
                    This project uses data from real NFL games to guess if a quarterback will throw a touchdown in a game. I used Python and machine learning tools like Scikit-learn and XGBoost. It reached about 88% accuracy.
                </p>
                <p>I also made a web app where users can upload game stats and get predictions instantly, with explanations for why the prediction was made.</p>

                <h3>Invoice Management System</h3>
                <p>
                    I created a system in Java that helps companies keep track of what they rent, lease, or buy. I connected it to a MySQL database and added features like reports and export tools. I wrote the logic myself and tested it using JUnit.

                <h3>♞ Knight’s Solver</h3>
                <p>
                    This was a fun challenge — I built a program that solves chess-based puzzles using recursion and backtracking. The knight on the board had to move to every square only once. I used Python and NumPy to visualize the moves.

                    I worked on home repairs where we fixed cracked foundations using special systems. I was responsible for leading a small team, making sure things were done safely and correctly. I learned teamwork, leadership, and attention to detail.
